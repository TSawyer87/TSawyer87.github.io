privacy concerns.</p></blockquote><h3 id=-key-terms>üîë Key Terms</h3><details><summary>‚úîÔ∏è Click to Expand Key Terms</summary><div><ul><li><p><strong>IP</strong> (Internet Protocol) is the address system of the internet, responsible
for delivering packets of data from a source device to a target device. IP is
the main way in which connections are made, and is the backbone of the
internet. It doesn&rsquo;t check for errors or ensure the packets are in the correct
order, that&rsquo;s where TCP comes in. When you set an <code>IP rule</code> this is what
you&rsquo;re setting, a trusted IP address.</p></li><li><p><strong>Port</strong>: A port in networking is a virtual communication endpoint managed by
a computer&rsquo;s operating system that helps direct network traffic to specific
apps or services. While an IP address identifies a device on a network, ports
allow the system to know exactly which app or service should handle the
incoming or outgoing data. Web traffic commonly uses port 80 (HTTP) or 443
(HTTPS), so when data arrives for those ports, it&rsquo;s routed to the web server
application on the device. When we block port 80, we block insecure HTTP
connections.</p></li><li><p><strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) is responsible for maintaining a
connection through a handshake and putting the packets in the correct order.
TCP will also ask for missing pieces and is known as a reliable but slow
protocol.</p></li><li><p><strong>UDP</strong> (User Datagram Protocol) (UDP/IP): is a fast protocol used across the
internet for time-sensitive transmissions such as DNS lookups or VoIP. UDP
allows a computer to send data straight to another without requiring a
handshake.</p></li><li><p><strong>DNS Server</strong>: When you search for a domain name (rethinkdns.com) it triggers
a DNS lookup. Several different types of DNS servers typically work together
to complete a single DNS lookup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recursive resolver</strong> (DNS recursor): is typically the first stop in the
series of the above servers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interative resolver</strong>: In an iterative DNS query, each DNS server responds
directly to the client with a referral to another server, and the client
continues querying successive servers until it receives the IP address for the
requested domain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proxy</strong>: A proxy, in relation to Orbot with Rethink, is an intermediary
service that routes internet traffic from your device through the Tor network
to provide privacy and anonymity.</p></li><li><p><code>Bypass DNS and Firewall</code>: When you choose this setting, it does exactly that.
The app that is allowed to bypass will not have it&rsquo;s traffic routed through
the Rethink encrypted tunnel and will fall back to your systems Private DNS
setting. Rethink will still be aware of the app but it won&rsquo;t route its
traffic.</p></li><li><p><code>Bypass Universal</code>: Similar to <code>Bypass DNS and Firewall</code> with the added bypass
of any filters or blocklists. So your extreme privacy blocklist won&rsquo;t block
this app. Rethink will still be aware of said app.</p></li><li><p><code>Exclude</code>: Rethink will not be aware of this app and it will not be routed
through RethinkDNS.</p></li><li><p>üõú(Unmetered Wi-Fi): Wi-Fi settings, either blocked or allowed.</p></li><li><p>üì∂ (Metered mobile): Mobile data settings, either blocked or allowed.</p></li></ul></div></details><h2 id=rethinkdns-overview>RethinkDNS Overview</h2><p>The DNS mode routes all DNS traffic generated by all apps to <strong>any</strong> user chosen
DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, DNSCrypt, or Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS resolver.</p><p>Firewalls like Rethink that block both UDP and TCP connections are usually
sufficient because nearly all applications rely on these two protocols for their
networking and communication. Almost every app communicates over TCP or UDP, so
blocking these protocols effectively restricts most network traffic from and to
apps, preventing them from connecting without permission.</p><p>I will share how I use RethinkDNS, obviously feel free to make changes based on
your threat model and needs.</p><h2 id=getting-started>Getting Started</h2><h3 id=dns>DNS</h3><p>Go to <code>Configure -> DNS -> Other DNS</code>:</p><ul><li><p>Choose the type of resolver you want, I use DNSCrypt. Once you click you can
choose the specific resolver you want such as Quad9. You may notice that it
says <code>Failed: using fallback DNS</code>. This is only because we haven&rsquo;t turned it
on yet, we will recheck this once we turn it on.</p></li><li><p>If you want a relay in a specific country, you can click the <code>Relays</code> tab. For
DNSCrypt you are given the choice between the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Los
Angeles, and Singapore. You might do this if you were trying to circumvent
censorship.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Rules</strong> set the following:</p><ul><li><p><code>Advanced DNS filtering (experimental)</code>: Assign unique IP per DNS request.</p></li><li><p><code>Prompt on blocklist updates</code></p></li></ul><p>Leave all the <code>Advanced</code> defaults unless you want to turn on <code>Never proxy DNS</code></p><hr><h3 id=network>Network</h3><p>Go to <code>Configure -> Network</code>:</p><ul><li><p>Set <code>Use all available networks</code> to ON. This enables Wifi and mobile data to
be used at the same time by Rethink. (Optional, may use more battery)</p></li><li><p><strong>Set your IP version</strong>: The default is <code>IPv4</code>, you can choose between
<code>IPv6 (experimental)</code> and <code>Auto (experimental)</code> if you use IPv6.</p></li><li><p>Using the <code>Loopback</code> sounds like a good idea but it makes many of the
resolvers fail.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose fallback DNS</strong>: When your user-preferred DNS is not reachable,
fallback DNS will be used.</p></li><li><p>You may want to experiment with shutting off <code>Enable network visibility</code>, just
keep in mind that some apps may break. Shutting this off prevents apps from
accessing all available networks, stopping them from bypassing Rethinks
tunnel. This caused issues with the browser when turned off.</p></li></ul><hr><h3 id=firewall>Firewall</h3><p>Go to <code>Configure -> Firewall -> Universal firewall rules</code> and set the following
to ON:</p><ul><li><p><code>Block all apps when device is locked</code></p></li><li><p><code>Block when DNS is bypassed</code></p></li><li><p><code>Block newly installed apps by default</code></p></li><li><p><code>Block port 80 (insecure HTTP) traffic</code></p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=turn-on-dns-and-firewall>Turn ON DNS and Firewall</h2><p>Go to <code>Home</code> üè†:</p><ul><li>Click the big <code>Start</code> button on the bottom of the screen and leave it set to
the default <code>DNS and Firewall (default)</code></li></ul><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve started the DNS and Firewall, we can go back to
<code>Configure -> DNS</code> and ensure the provider we chose started successfully. You
can also experiment with different types of resolvers, make sure to wait for
below the chosen resolver to say <code>Connected</code>.</p><p>Now, all of the apps on your device have a default to allow both Wi-Fi and
mobile data access <strong>through the RethinkDNS encrypted tunnel</strong>. Try some of your
most used Apps to see if they function correctly.</p><p>RethinkDNS‚Äôs firewall blocks or restricts any network traffic that isn‚Äôt
explicitly allowed. Although by default all apps are allowed, some apps require
special permissions or bypasses due to their network behavior. Many apps rely on
multiple external services, backend APIs, etc. that may be blocked by the
firewall.</p><hr><h3 id=apps-that-dont-work>Apps that Don&rsquo;t work</h3><p>I will use Reddit as an example, the process is the same for any app. Reddit‚Äôs
app and website rely on multiple third-party services and external domains
beyond just <code>reddit.com</code> itself.</p><p>For apps that don&rsquo;t work it&rsquo;s important to ensure that your systems
<code>Private DNS</code> is set to <code>Automatic</code>.</p><p>Go to <code>Home -> Apps</code>:</p><p>Search for <code>Reddit</code>, click on it and the Firewall Rules For Reddit will pop up.
Since it is already allowed <code>Unmetered</code> and <code>Metered</code> connections and still
doesn&rsquo;t work, we can try one setting at a time until it does work and this is
the same process for other Apps that aren&rsquo;t working.</p><ul><li><p>First, you can try allowing the app to <code>Bypass DNS & Firewall</code>. Try the app
again, does it work? If not:</p></li><li><p><code>Bypass Universal</code>, this allows it to ignore any filters or blocklists as
well. If the app still doesn&rsquo;t work you can:</p></li><li><p><code>Exclude</code> the app. This makes RethinkDNS completely unaware of the app and is
often what is required for Reddit. It is my understanding that after you
<code>Exclude</code> Reddit for example, your systems Automatic Secure DNS will pick it
up.</p></li><li><p>You can also <code>Isolate</code> an App, you then have to set up <em>trust | allow</em> rules
for domains or IPs over a period of time which can take a while. You can go to
<code>Apps</code> and search for the app in question, click on it and at the bottom of
the screen you&rsquo;ll see <code>IP Logs</code>, and <code>Domain Logs</code> to help with this.</p></li></ul><hr><h3 id=firefox-encrypted-dns-through-rethink>Firefox Encrypted DNS through Rethink</h3><p>First, make sure you can visit a few sites in Firefox. If you can, then your
browser traffic should be routed through the Rethink tunnel, we will check here.
If you can&rsquo;t, go to <code>Home -> Apps</code> and search for Firefox, is networking
enabled?</p><p><strong>RethinkDNS Settings</strong></p><p>For the best experience routing your browser traffic through your custom
endpoint (e.g., DNSCrypt) ensure the following are set:</p><ul><li><p>Do not turn on <code>Block any app not in use</code> in the Universal firewall. After
some Log digging, I found that this causes the browser to fail more often than
not.</p></li><li><p><code>Configure -> Network -> Enable network visibility</code> set to the default ON. I
had experimented with turning this off and certain websites wouldn&rsquo;t load when
on Wi-Fi and none would load on mobile data. Turning it back on seemed to fix
both with no leaks detected.</p></li></ul><p>Double check that in Rethink&rsquo;s <code>Configure -> DNS</code>, ensure the default,
<code>Prevent DNS leaks</code> is set as well as the Universal Firewalls
<code>Block when DNS is bypassed</code>.</p><p><strong>Firefox Settings</strong></p><blockquote><p>In Firefox, plug <code>about:config</code> into the URL bar and scroll down to
<code>network.ttr.mode</code> and change its value to <code>3</code>. To prevent leaking DNS queries
to the System resolver. I say scroll because when I did it, the search didn&rsquo;t
find <code>network.ttr.mode</code>.</p></blockquote><p>In Firefox <code>Settings -> Privacy & Security</code>, set <code>DNS over HTTPS</code> to
<code>Default Protection</code>, this enables Firefox to use RethinkDNS&rsquo;s DNSCrypt resolver
or whatever you chose.</p><p><strong>Checking for DNS Leaks</strong></p><p>Go to:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-text data-lang=text><span style=display:flex><span>https://dnsleaktest.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For DNSCrypt with Quad9 Security, <code>dnsleaktest</code> found 5 servers all with the ISP
<code>WoodyNet</code> indicating success through Quad9. Quad9 relies on Packet Clearing
House, that&rsquo;s where the <code>WoodyNet</code> name comes from.</p><p>When on mobile data, when going to <code>https://dnsleaktest.com</code> the results showed
6 <code>WoodyNet</code> servers instead of 5.</p><p>A different solution could be to experiment with more strict RethinkDNS settings
and just use the browsers built-in DNS over HTTPS on max protection. Having more
strict defaults for Rethink with all of your apps and configuring your browser
separate may be a better option, the choice is yours.</p><p>When hunting down a solution you can go to <code>Configure -> Logs</code>, then try to
visit the site that wouldn&rsquo;t work while watching the logs. You should see
<code>Firefox</code> pop up, click it, in the top right of the pop up should be the reason
it was blocked.</p><hr><h3 id=duckduckgo>DuckDuckGo</h3><p>I also tested DuckDuckGo with its stock configuration and <code>dnsleaktest.com</code>
showed that DDGs traffic was successfully tunneled through Rethink to Quad9s'
servers.</p><p>With DDG <code>dnsleaktest</code> only showed 4 <code>WoodyNet</code> servers, the lowest number yet.
I&rsquo;m not sure that less is necessarily always better in this case just something
to note.</p><hr><h4 id=chromium-based-browsers-brave>Chromium Based Browsers (Brave)</h4><p>Brave would not work when routed through Rethink and Chrome completely ignored
it. Brave is definitely better if you must use a Chrome derivative.</p><ul><li><p>I tried disabling the Brave Shield <code>Use Secure DNS</code> to see if that helped, it
didn&rsquo;t. There may be more you could do here to get it working&mldr;</p></li><li><p>I do have Chrome and google apps disabled on my main device and only active in
the Secure Folder which is like a sandboxed environment. This could very well
be the reason it ignored Rethink, I don&rsquo;t care to test further&mldr;</p></li><li><p><a href=https://techstory.in/eu-hits-google-with-3-5-billion-antitrust-fine-over-adtech-practices/>EU Hits Google with 3.5 Billion Antitrust</a></p></li></ul><hr><h3 id=more-fine-grained-control--enhanced-privacy>More Fine Grained Control & Enhanced Privacy</h3><blockquote><p>‚ùó NOTE: If you are happy with the functionality as is it is unnecessary to
follow these steps. If you already only install the minimal apps needed on
your phone (i.e. Only install what you use) you can probably just go to
individual Apps and block their networking that you are worried about such as
Facebook and Google. Routing all of your Apps through Rethink already gives
you great privacy and security benefits.</p></blockquote><p>If you read the following GrapheneOS discussion Forum:</p><ul><li><a href=https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/12728-proton-apps-pinging-google-api-sending-reports-back-after-opting-out/54>GrapheneOS Discussion Forum on Rethink</a></li></ul><p>It suggests you Go to <code>Home -> Apps</code> and right under <code>Showing all apps</code> click on
the grayed out üõúüì∂ to set a rule to <strong>block both Metered and Unmetered
connections to all apps by default</strong>.</p><p>The point here is that not every App on your device needs network access all the
time or at all in some cases. Watch your Logs and see which apps &ldquo;phone home&rdquo;
the most. Think about which Apps would leave you the most vulnerable and either
block network access completely or block and unblock as needed based on your
threat model.</p><p>I would recommend removing network access from your password manager until you
need it or better yet use something completely offline like
<a href=https://www.keepassdx.com/>KeePassDX</a>.</p><p>I have never used <code>Link to Windows</code> and I <code>Disable</code> & <code>Force Stop</code> it and
<code>Link to Windows</code> is still my most blocked App of all time by Rethink&mldr;</p><p>If you go for the default deny, you will have to search for every app that you
use and start by enabling networking and then following the
<code>Apps that don't work</code> section for each app until they work as expected. If you
really think about it, the number of apps that require constant networking
should be limited.</p><hr><h3 id=tor>Tor</h3><p>If you want to learn how Tor works, I suggest reading the following in this

online privacy worldwide.</p><p>By using Tor regularly for ordinary browsing, you help strengthen the network,
making it more robust and anonymous for everyone. This collective support makes
staying private easier for activists, journalists, and anyone facing online
surveillance or censorship. The writer of the PrivacyGuides article mentions
using Tor when he needs to access Google Maps to protect his privacy</p><p>So, consider embracing Tor not only for sensitive browsing but also for daily
routine tasks. Every user adds valuable noise to the network, helping protect
